# Lambda Lambda Lambda
More than an epic frat from the 80â€™s, today we have AWS Lambda, which is taking running code without servers to the next level. In this talk Chris Mitchell will go over the different ways to write Node.js applications that will run on the AWS Lambda serverless framework, including developing locally with debugging tools, deploying to the cloud, and exploring the Lambda console. An attendee should be familiar with Amazon Web Services and at a high level what Serverless technology using AWS Lambda is.
